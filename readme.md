# installation

1. Install Playwright using npm or yarn. Alternatively you can also get started and run your tests using the VS Code Extension:

```
npm install playwright
```

2. Install Homebrew (if not already installed). Homebrew is a package manager for macOS. You can install it by running the following command in the Terminal:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

3. Install Node.js from this link https://nodejs.org/en/download

- To verify that Node.js and npm were installed correctly, you can check their versions:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

- It's a good practice to update npm to the latest version:

```
npm install -g npm@latest
```

4. Clone repository:

```
clone https://github.com/paupuh/e2etests_jsplaywright.git
```
